- Refactored code with Angular to make index.html more readable. This involved adding custom directives (HTML tags) for these sections of the index page: account-login, logo-block, search-form, site-description.
- Added pages for links to go to. These include the Log In button, the Search button, and the invitation links.
- Added validation for login. Now, user cannot log in unless a username and password are provided. Also, Angular changes the border color of said input fields to show whether input is valid (green), invalid/blank because of deletion (red), or pristine (no color).
